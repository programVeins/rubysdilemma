## Disaster Strikes! 🌋
 
 Oh no! Ruby is face-to-face with a fire-breathing monster 🐲. A monster that wants to destroy Ruby and its habitat. It is a vicious creature indeed! It has insane power and is rampaging its way through the jungle. It has caused volcanoes all over the world to erupt and is causing chaos to planet Earth. Can you help Ruby choose an appropriate place to hide from the monster?
 
## Choosing a hiding spot
 
 Choosing a hiding spot for Ruby is quite simple. You need to check if any of the burrows already have a rabbit. If they do, Ruby cannot hide in there. The burrow needs to be empty before Ruby can fit in.
 
- Tap on a burrow to check if it is empty or occupied
 
- If it's empty, you're good to go!
 
- If a bunny already occupies the burrow, it will get angry 😡! Try another hole!
 
Once Ruby is inside the burrow, let's see what happens in the [**next stage**](@next)!
