## Realization 🤔
 
Ruby has now reached her safe chamber. But she's only safe as long as the monster does not realize her hiding place. Ruby begins to ponder and realizes that everything that she has seen so far has been an illusion 🪄
 
 She concludes that her vision 👁 was blurred, and the things she witnessed might have been different. She needs your help in decluttering her thoughts.
 
 ## Delve into Ruby's thought process 💭
 
 Ruby tries to make sense of what has happened so far. Can you help her make meaningful conclusions? 
 
 There are three questions, and choose the correct answer to move on to the next one. If you choose a wrong answer, a ❌ mark appears on the choice, prompting you to choose a different option. Once you are done with all 3 of them, you may move on to the conclusive [**final stage**](@next)!
