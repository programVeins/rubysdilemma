## Conclusions 👩🏾‍🎓👨🏾‍🎓
 
## After all, the monster was a **human being**
 
 Humans pose the biggest threat to Earth's environment and other living creatures. There are several alarming 🚨 statistics about our misadventure on earth, like the following:
 
 - Estimated total global CO2 emissions 💨 as of 2018 totals to around **36.44 Billion Metric Tons**, and That's A LOT!
 
 - Up to **28,000 species** 🦧 can go extinct in the next 25 years as a result of deforestation
 
 - In about a hundred years, all known rainforests 🌳🌳 would **vanish**!
 
 -  Every second, a forest 🌳🌳 the size of a **football field** 🏟 is lost, according to the deforestation statistics for 2021.
  
 Humans have always been the reason for the deterioration of mother nature. We take Earth for granted and pollute the environment as we like it, without realizing the drastic consequences. We also litter up our land with trash 🗑 that is either toxic, medical or, e-waste. All this intoxication causes **climate changes** and affects Earth's state of livelihood for animals and humans alike.

 Climate change and its consequences are imminent and, we need to reinvent our lifestyles. We need to do our part to save ourselves and animals like Ruby from doomsday. Yes, we are the most dangerous monsters 👹 to ever walk the Earth, but collectively we have the power to stop this from happening. The fate of humanity lies with humankind.

 Let's vow to stop misusing science and instead use it to contribute towards the betterment of Earth and its ecosystem. Plant more trees, avoid deforestation, reduce the overall pollution and choose cleaner alternatives ♻️ in our everyday routine. ✨
