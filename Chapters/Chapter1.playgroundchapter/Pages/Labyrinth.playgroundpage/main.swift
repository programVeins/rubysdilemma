## Navigate the Labyrinth 🧠
 
Oh no! The dragon is now breathing fire 🔥 into the burrow! This was uncalled for. Can you help Ruby quickly evade the fire and navigate the cumbersome labyrinth built by her fellow bunny mates?
 
 
 * Callout(Getting started with AR):
     - After running the code, point your device's camera at a flat surface and move around to scan the environment.
     - Once done, tap anywhere the screen to place the Labyrinth model.
     - If the model does not appear, continue moving your device around for a few more seconds.
     - After the model is placed, you can start tapping on the pointer pads!
     - Once you have completed the stage, you can stop the code and move on to the next stage.

 ## Okay this is how Ruby looks in real life

 You can navigate the labyrinth by pressing on one these pointer pads:

 You are given the choice to tap on multiple pointer pads 👉🏿 and Ruby moves to that point. **But be careful!** If you move in a direction that is a dead-end, the monster's fire lava floods the entire tunnel!

 Once you have lead Ruby to safety, let's see what happens in the [**next stage**](@next)!
